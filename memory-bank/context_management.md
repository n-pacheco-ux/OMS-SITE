# Context Window Management Strategy

## Problem Statement

Large memory bank files, particularly `progress.md`, can create significant context window load issues. This results in:

1. **Reduced Performance**: Large context windows increase processing time
2. **Information Overload**: Critical current tasks get buried in historical data
3. **Redundancy**: Completed tasks remain in active memory but add no immediate value
4. **Inefficient References**: Difficulty finding relevant information quickly

## Solution: Memory Bank Restructuring

We've implemented a multi-file approach to manage context efficiently:

### File Structure

1. **progress.md**
   - Purpose: Focus on current status and immediate next steps
   - Content: Only Phase 1 remaining work and active issues
   - Context size: Minimized to essential information only

2. **archive.md**
   - Purpose: Store historical completed tasks and fixed issues
   - Content: All completed work and associated learnings
   - Usage: Reference when needed for historical context or verification

3. **future_plans.md**
   - Purpose: Document planned Phase 2 and beyond features
   - Content: Detailed future enhancements beyond current development phase
   - Usage: Reference during planning discussions or phase transitions

4. **context_management.md** (this file)
   - Purpose: Explain the context management strategy
   - Content: Documentation on memory bank organization and best practices
   - Usage: Reference when updating memory bank files

### Best Practices for Context Management

1. **Current Focus Principle**: Keep only currently relevant information in `progress.md`
2. **Archive Regularly**: Move completed items to `archive.md` promptly
3. **Future Planning**: Add new long-term ideas to `future_plans.md` rather than `progress.md`
4. **Cross-Reference**: Use file links to reference information in other memory bank files
5. **Summarize**: Replace detailed explanations with concise summaries and links
6. **Maintain Structure**: Follow consistent formatting across all memory bank files

## Implementation Notes

- This restructuring was implemented on April 10, 2025
- All references to missing assets (e.g., partnership.jpg) were removed as they created unnecessary context load
- The streamlined approach significantly reduces context window size while preserving all valuable information

## Usage Guidelines

When updating the memory bank:

1. Assess whether new information belongs in current progress or future plans
2. Archive completed items promptly after verification
3. Keep summaries concise and use linking for details
4. Regularly review the memory bank structure to identify optimization opportunities

By following this strategy, we maintain an efficient context window while preserving comprehensive project documentation.
