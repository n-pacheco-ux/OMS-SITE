- When updating page content that uses translations, both HTML and language.js file must be updated
- Typography choices significantly impact brand identity
- Consistent referencing of the design style guide ensures visual coherence
- Creating a comprehensive spacing system with CSS variables leads to more consistent layouts
- Minimalist design principles improve readability and user experience
- Reducing visual complexity creates a more refined appearance
